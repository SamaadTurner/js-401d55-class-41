# Todo App
For labs 41-42 I will be making a to-do app that lets you create, add, and delete tasks. You will also be able to use camera to take a picture of whatever you like.

# Compatibility
- IOS
- Android


# How to Start app

- npm start: will get you to the CLI where you can choose whatever device you want to simulate app on.

# WireFrame:
